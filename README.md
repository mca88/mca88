## 🦆 About me

I love ducks 🦆, music 🎵, films 🎦, videogames 🎮 and robots 🤖. I got into programming because I kept forgetting things. Now I just write them down in code and make the computer remember them instead. Who needs a good memory when you’ve got Git? I also love ducks 🦆.

## 🌍 My fields

### Data engineer

I worked as a Data Engineer using Python, PySpark, Azure Databricks, and Azure Data Lake.
In this role, I was responsible for maintaining the ETL pipeline that extracted data from the Riot Games API about League of Legends matches.

### NLP researcher

My goal in this role was to research an NLP model capable of extracting the most important information from notarial texts. For this project, I used Python, TensorFlow, and a BERT-based NLP model from Hugging Face. I was also responsible for formatting and normalizing the documents used for the model’s fine-tuning.


### Robotic engineer

In my current position, I work with service robots (waiters, receptionists, cleaning robots...).

To program these robots, I use Android Studio with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. I also designed the backend used by these applications for communication, using technologies such as MQTT, WebSockets, and REST APIs. I'm also responsible for reviewing and maintaining the development team's codebase using tools like GitHub.

Additionally, I play a key role in the deployment of the applications, using technologies like GCP, Vercel, Jenkins, NGINX, and Docker — all to ensure proper CI/CD across the entire ecosystem surrounding the robots and their applications.

## 🎯 Hobbies and Interests:

In my free time, I like to research about new technologies and create fun and useful apps. I'm currently developing a multiplayer web app to play "El pueblo duerme" ("Mafia" in english) with friends. 

I also enjoy discovering new songs or movies recommended by others.
